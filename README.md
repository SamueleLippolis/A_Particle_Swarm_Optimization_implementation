# GMO_exam
Repository where I store all the used files for the GMO exam.

## Important remark
My project consists in implementing the PSO method on the framework JGEA. 
The code we did (I use "we" since the professor Eric Medvet helped me) has a meaning if it is within JGEA.
However, I reported here the isolated code we did in the folder "code".

## The main pdf file
The main file is \\
GMO_project___A_PSO_implementation_on_GJEA___Samuele_Lippolis-1.pdf \\
in which I reported all the information about the project.

## The folders
### code
The code we did.
* ParticleSwarmOptimization: proper class where I store all the information related to the implementation of PSO
* Solvers: here there are a lot of (not commented, previous implemented) constructurs. The only that regards the project is the "pso" construct. 
### benchmarks 
The benchmark I did. 
Here I put only one benchmark, but with slightly modification it can be used for all the simulations I did.
I used the "Starter" class to run this benchamrk.
### plots
The plots of the simulations
