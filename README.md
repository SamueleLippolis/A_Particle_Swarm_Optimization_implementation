# GMO_exam
Repository where I store all the used files for the GMO exam.

## Important remark
My project consists in implementing the PSO method on the framework JGEA. 
The code we did (I use "we" since the professor Eric Medvet helped me) has a meaning if it is within JGEA.
However, I reported here the isolated code we did in the folder "code".

## The main pdf file
The main file is the pdf in which I reported all the information about the project.

## The folders
### code

### benchmarks 
The benchmark I did. 
Here I put only one benchmark, but with slightly modification it can be used for all the simulations I did.
I used the "Starter" class to run this benchamrk.
### plots
